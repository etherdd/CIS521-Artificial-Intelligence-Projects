### 1. N-Queens
In a chessboard, a queen can attack any piece that lies in the same row, column, or diagonal as
itself. The search will return a list of all valid placements of queens on an board. 
   
### 2. Lights Out
The Lights Out puzzle consists of an grid of lights, each of which has two states: on and
off. The goal of the puzzle is to turn all the lights off. The search will return a shortest way to switch all the lights off.

### 3. Linear Disks

each step, a disk can only be moved to an a djacent empty cell, or to an empty cell two spaces
a way if another disk is located on the intervening square. The search will return a shortest way to move all the disks.
